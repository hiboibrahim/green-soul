            <h1>Food Cooperative  </h1>
            <h5>Food co-ops are run by volunteers from the community, come in all shapes and sizes and can be found in a variety of settings, â€“ from community centres, schools, universities, church halls or workplaces. Unlike food banks, Food Co-ops are not just for people in food crises. They are open to everyone.</h5>
              <p>We believe everyone has the right to good food. One of our key Good Food Goals for the city is to ensure that everyone; has access to, has choice over and can afford; nourishing, healthy and culturally appropriate food.

But if you are struggling to afford or access food, there are a number of systems in place to help, which we have signposted below. </p>
